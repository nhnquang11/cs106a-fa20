Although Unicode requires extra work and time, it benefits a lot. Exclusively using ASCII might lead to a lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The need for respect and a sense of belonging is an essential part of creating an inclusive environment. If people don't feel like they belong (cause your program cannot represent their name correctly in their language), they will struggle to fully engage and contribute to your project. Worsely, they gonna leave and not contribute anything, which can impact the data and your decision-making. Additionally, your company can lose money due to this underrepresentation. So it's better to persuade your boss or leave and start up your own company.
